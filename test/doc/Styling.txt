Information on using this styling template:

This styling system is designed to be relatively hands-off, where all needed styles should be already included in the .css files.
There are a few .css files, split up by main purpose:
  main.css: Contains important styling rules pertainent to the entire website
  header.css: Contains all styling pertaining to the header
  content.css: Everything for regular content in articles and whatnot
  footer.css: Everything for the Footer Section
  cards.css: Subset of Content, everything for the Flashcard and Titlecard Stylings
  form.css: Everything for using Forms
  articles.css: Everything for displaying Article Snippets, as would show up in the Table of Contents
  
Mobile Phone (or portrait screen shape) should be inline with the CSS Stylings. There will be no specific mobile site.

For Headers:
  There are 3 available styles:
    Two-lined Topbar
    One-lined Topbar
    Sidebar
  Every item in the links menu should ALWAYS be surrounded by something:
    <li><span/a/...></...></li>
For Flashcards:
  There are a few styles:
    White background
    Gradient Backgrounds
    Image Background (specify Image in the HTML file)
  There are containers:
    Regular Content Container
    Left/Right Container
For Content:
  It is recommended to use the Content Container to make content more readable
  If the header is a sidebar, be sure to set the class to "sidebar" to make the margins correct.
For Footers:
  If the Header is displayed as a sidebar, then there should be no footer, or a very minimal one that also accounts for the sidebar
