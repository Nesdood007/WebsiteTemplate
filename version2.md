# Webtemplate 2.0

_Style Name not yet determined_

This is a revitalization and upgrade to my existing Website template.

## Fix issues with the initial WebTemplate:

1. Broken `<code>` layout

2. Fragmented CSS Coloring and global styles

    - This is meant to allow for color schemes by way of using CSS Variables
    
    - this can also be used to create a 'dark mode'
    
3. Too many Styled Elements

    - Some extraneous elements will lose their custom styling
    
4. Wonky Form Styling

    - Form styling will be adjusted to look more modern and not cover everything up
    
5. Separate Menu Bar and Title Header

    - Bring together the Title bar and Menu header
    
6. Lack of Modularity

    - Make it easier to use _mix-in_ stylesheets that override the default styling
    
7. Too Many CSS Files

    - Consolidate the CSS into fewer files
    
## Add new features

- Theme-colored Elements

- Actually USeful Documentation

    - Include Guidelines for Custom Elements
