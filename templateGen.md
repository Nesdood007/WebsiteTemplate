# Header and Footer Generation

There should be an easy way to generate the Header and Footer Links. This will allow the Template to be modified easily without having to manually edit multiple template files. I believe that it would be easiest to utilize a JSON File to Store Links and properties of the Menus, Dropdowns, and Links.
